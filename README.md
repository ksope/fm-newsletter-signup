## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learnt how to save data n the browser's localStorage and retrieve it. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```javascript
form.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (email.value === "") {
        showError(email, "Valid email required");
    } else if (!checkEmail(email)) {
        showError(email, "Email is not valid");
    } else {
        const inputValue = email.value;
        localStorage.setItem("userInputValue", inputValue); // Store the value in local storage
        showSuccess(email, "./confirmation.html");
    }
});
```

```javascript
const storedValue = localStorage.getItem("userInputValue");

            // Display the email
            if (storedValue) {
                document.getElementById("contact").innerText = storedValue;
            } else {
                document.getElementById("contact").innerText =
                    "No email found.";
            }
```


### Continued development

Unit testing using jest. I intend to implement this feature later.

### Useful resources
